# profile-generator

Profile Generator is a program that allows one to create an employee database for either Manager, Engineer, or Intern.

An HTML document is then created containing employee information with the corresponding email, employee ID, and either the Office number, github username or school name depending on if the user has selected Manager Engineer, or Intern.

This was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

Javascript was used to pull the Jest and Inquirer libraries in order to both execute test to ensure user has properly created the Employee, Intern, Engineer and Manager classes and also using Inquirer to take user input where the employee database is created.

Here are the screenshots:
